# Cochlear Sound Processor Simulator

**What does sound look like to a cochlear implant?**  
This project simulates how cochlear implants convert sound into patterns of electrical stimulation using Python.

Developed as part of a biomedical engineering project, the tool allows users to load audio, apply different sound processing strategies, and visualise how each strategy shapes the auditory signal delivered to the auditory nerve.

## Features

- Load and play `.wav` audio files  
- Apply three cochlear implant strategies: F0F1F2, CIS, and ACE  
- Visualise time-domain waveforms and electrodograms  
- Use an interactive, beginner-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
